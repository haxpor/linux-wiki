Listening to changes event of file then execute a command
=========================================================

I often see in webdev ecosystem especially thing like `gulp` or other similar tools which often
has configurations set to listen to changes event of several files, then do something. Most likely
to process and produce output to be shown on local web server for quick debugging experience. So
developers don't have to switch terminal tab to execute processing command, then switch back.
Minimal time wasted.

So today I think about it, did some research to find a solution that can be done the same on Linux
system. What we need is `inotifywait`.

Install it with

      sudo apt install inotifywait

Then let's say you want to execute `pandoc` command to convert input `.txt` file into `.html` whenever
a target file is modified[^1]. We do it like this

      while inotifywait -e modify src/topic.txt || true; do pandoc src/topic.txt -o posts/topic.html; done

I need `|| true` to make it executes the command, not quit, and keep waiting for future events.

That's it.
